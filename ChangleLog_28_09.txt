Shotgunner. 
	Changed the move speed to 13 from 15, noticed a little difference and prefer the speed where its hard to predict where to shoot due to being a different speed than the kamikaze for example. 

	Circle Speed was halved. I had trouble shooting the shotgunner whilst it was strafing around me as it moved too fast to both aim and move yourself. 
	
	Max circle distance was also closed to 7.5 so the shotgunner won't get as close as the kamikaze and but will be a considerable distance. 

Kamikaze
	Added in Kamikaze with values

	Move Speed : 15

Added Blocks to the scene, including walls so its an enclosed arena. AI have no idea what to do with the blocks. They treat them like they don't exist.
